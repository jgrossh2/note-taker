# Note Taker

## Description

The Note Taker application was created in order to help organize a list of notes from a user. After navigating through the homepage, the user is able to enter a note title and description, and then save the note to a list. This list will persist even if the server restarts. Any note can be revisited by clicking on the saved note, or deleted.
